# Ray Tracing in a Weekend

So I initially wrote my ray-the-tracer when I was just starting to learn Go and I was using
version 3.x of the Ray Tracing in One Weekend book.  Since then I've learned a lot about Go
and version 4.0 of the book has been released.  I'm interested in restarting this project
partly because I think I can do it better than I did before, but also because I want to try 
out the other follow on books and I figured I should probably refresh my memory.
