# Ray Tracing in a Weekend

So I initially wrote my ray-the-tracer when I was just starting to
learn Go and I was using version 3.x of the [Ray Tracing in One
Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html)
book.  Since then I've learned a lot about Go (and Go has changed a
fair bit) and version 4.0 of the book has been released.  I'm
interested in restarting this project partly because I think I can do
it better than I did before, but also because I want to try out the
other follow on books and I figured I should probably refresh my
memory.
